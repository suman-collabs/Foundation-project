Accpetance Testing Summary Report

The app works as intended and performs the functions as requirements; however, it can be improved in many areas to make the user's experience easy and smooth. The intended use of the service is intuitive in general. The user can naturally navigate and use the service without following detailed instruction. However, the service doesn't inspire confidence beacause of security isssue being compromised. The service could also see some improvements in the User Interface.

Specific Issues:

As a general user, on the home page, "Create an Account" button should have been larger.
While typing the password, "show password" option should have been added, and required to enter the password again for confirmation
When the account is created, the display message shouldn't have shown the password which is a huge security issue
There should have been a link to take you back to the login page, or it should have taken the user directly to the home page
The alert messages when error occurs are vague and should be specific to let the user know about the issue like:
When no unique username is provided, "user already exists" is a better alert message than failed
When adding already existing planet, "Planet already exists" message should be displayed instead of just failed.
When removing Planet/Moon, clear alert message with the reason and instruction should be displayed for the user.
When adding only photo. "Enter name of the Planet/Moon" should be displayed instead of just failed.
When adding duplicate values, "Resources already exist" messages should be displayed.
The Planet/Moon could be managed and sorted with sort by options, and related resources should have been displayed together.

Due to these issues, even though the intended use of service is intuitive and easy to use, the service doesn't provide the user with sense of security, and doesn't inspire confidence with so many critical issues. The home page is good with the good background of universe, but the login page of the application is not pleasing to look at and doesn't keep up with the theme of the app and the home page.
