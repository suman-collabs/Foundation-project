This Sprint was agood learning experience about the software testing lifecycle and the strategies used for testing where activities like the manual testing was easier but tedious, learned from mistakes to make improvements on the next Sprint.

Things were vague and hard to understand for me at first, but they got easier as I kept on working on the projects. Practise makes perfect couldn't be more true. A lot of the terms used in Testing Lifecycle and also in Scrum sounded similar when I started, and I was able to understand what they were as I kept on working on the project. Testing techniques including Boundry-value, eequivalence partitioning, exploratory and error guessing all were helpful to come up with strategies to solve the test cases. Some of the test cases had similar strategies which made process familiar and faster.

I learned that littles steps taken everyday makes a huge impact on the workload and also knowledge retention. I underestimated the time it would take to make the test case and also the test execution. Little progress made is better than no progress, so I learned to start working on project without having the steps to be perfect.

On my next Sprint, I will need to automate a lot of manual testing saving myself from the iterative and time consuming processes.
